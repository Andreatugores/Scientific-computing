### What is Git?
* * *
Git is more than a website, Git is a control version software, which is a software made for tracking changes in any set of files in a directory. 
Managing changes of your documents, data, notebooks and coding scripts is essential when you do research. As you probably have learned by now, just copying your files and renaming them as "myProjectUpdateFinalTrueFinalPrint.ipynb" is not the most efficient way to do so. Git makes it easier by providing an online  plataform for Version Control of personal and collaborative projects. 

### What is a Git repository?
* * *
The Git software stores and save files to a directory called repository, also shorten as repo. A Git repository allows various operations to create different versions of the files in it.
A Git repository can be local (placed in your computer) or remote (hosted on the Internet, or in a different server).
By installing git to your computer, and creating a GitHub or GitLab account you can start your Version Control with git.

### What does a git fork/git clone do?
* * *
From Github or Gitlab you can Fork and Clone repositories.
A git fork is an operation of copying a repository to your git account.
A git clone is an operation of copying a repository to your local machine.
Maybe you knew all of this already. In fact, you probably have this program running because you did a git clone to your computer (or Virtual Machine, for that matter).
One more thing before you continue: remember than you can only push to git repositories where you have permissions to do so. If you need to clone a repo that you do not own and need to make changes, fork the repo first and then you can clone it.

### What does a git init do?
* * *
You can obtain a Git repository by either cloning a Git repository or by converting a local directory to a Git repository, using git init. 
It does not matter if the directory is a new local directory, or an already existent local directory, the command git init works in both cases.
And you can also git init a git repository, is it safe to do so, it will not overwrite files that are already there.

### Git push and the previous steps.
* * *
Git push is an operation to publish new local commits on a remote server.
When you want to update your changes (could be a new file in the directory, or a change in an already existing file) to your Git account, you need to git push.
But before a git push, you have to git add (to add your new or modified files to your git repo), git commit (to save these changes) and then you an execute your git push command.
There could be more commands that you need to execute before a git push. 
This is only a basic review, and although the tutorial will include some new steps. You can learn more in the documentation and you should.

### Git pull
* * *
While Git push allows you to publish local commits on a remote server, the git pull command lets you update the local version with the new commits saved on the remote server. It is the most common way to update a repository and you should use it after everytime that you interact with the remote server.    
Note that this tutorial does not include how to git pull although it is being considered for future versions. If you need to git pull, we recommend to consult the documentation available in the repository and the program.
